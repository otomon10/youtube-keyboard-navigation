# YouTube Keyboard Navigation

A Chrome extension that makes YouTube video selection accessible through simple keyboard controls, designed for users with physical disabilities or those who prefer keyboard navigation.

## ✨ Features

- **WASD Navigation**: Move through YouTube video thumbnails using familiar gaming controls
- **Visual Highlighting**: Selected videos are highlighted with a bright green border for clear visibility
- **Simple Controls**: Minimal learning curve with intuitive key mappings
- **Auto-detection**: Automatically finds and highlights video thumbnails on any YouTube page
- **Dynamic Loading**: Supports YouTube's infinite scroll by detecting new content
- **Shorts Hiding**: Automatically hides YouTube Shorts sections for a cleaner browsing experience
- **Compact Layout**: Collapses sidebar by default and compresses video metadata to display more thumbnails on screen
- **Enhanced Scanning**: Reduced spacing and text sizes allow for quick visual scanning of more content

## 🎮 Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `A` | Move left (previous video) |
| `D` | Move right (next video) |
| `W` | Move up (jump 5 videos back) |
| `S` | Move down (jump 5 videos forward) |
| `Enter` | Play selected video |
| `R` | Return to YouTube home |

### Page-specific behavior

- **Home / Search pages**: All controls are active with visual highlighting
- **Video watch pages**: Navigation keys (WASD, Enter) are disabled to allow YouTube's default video controls (arrow keys for seeking, etc.). Only `R` key works to return home.
